## LeetHub
I found a really cool extension a couple of weeks ago, called [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub/), but it only supported syncing problems and solutions from LeetCode. Here in India, there's another really good website for DSA stuff: [GeeksForGeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org), so I just modified that extension to include GeeksForGeeks submissions.
